# Coming Soon - Codelab

FirebaseUI 0.4.0 contains many API changes that make the original **Building a
chat application with FirebaseUI for Android** codelab out of date. We are
working hard to bring you a shiny new codelab as soon as we can.

If you are using an older version of FirebaseUI and want to access the old
codelab, [click here](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/blob/a8d7988e0a9ec93650c864997124205816ea4856/codelabs/chat/README.md).

If you want to learn how to build a fully featured Android app using all of
the new Firebase APIs, [click here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-android).
